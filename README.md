# Environmental-Sound-Classification-using-CNN

The purpose of this project is classifying different sound
groups based on their spectrogram using CNN model. The
goal of this is getting higher accuracy compared to other
classification models. In the project, the CNN is used as
a classification model since the image representation of the
audio files are used. The project is consisting of multiple data
pre-processing steps to get the image representation of the
audio files and labeled the data.
